thanks for contributing to swarmlog-manager! see "todos" below for current priorities

## setting up a wrtc environment

### method 1 (easy)

run in a wrtc enabled environment by building a browser bundle with `browserify` and requiring it in some index.html

### method 2 (wacky)

just turn off your wifi!

## todo

we may want to (optionally) protect keys with a password. a password passed into the manger could be used to unlock keys that are encrypted at rest in the leveldb
